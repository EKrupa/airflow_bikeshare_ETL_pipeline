            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>
                I’m <strong>Evan Krupa</strong>, a Python-focused <strong>Data Engineer and Web Developer</strong>
                with a passion for building scalable, data-driven systems and clean, user-centered applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                My background bridges <strong>data engineering</strong> and <strong>web development</strong>,
                allowing me to work comfortably across the stack. I design and orchestrate ETL pipelines using
                <strong>Python, Apache Airflow, SQL</strong>, and deploy cloud-native solutions on
                <strong>AWS</strong> (S3, EC2). I enjoy building reliable, production-ready data workflows
                that support analytics and decision-making.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the web side, I develop responsive applications with <strong>Django</strong>, HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript—focusing on clean architecture, readable code, and intuitive interfaces that
                support complex backend logic.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of tech, I’m a <strong>musician</strong> who plays <strong>guitar and piano</strong>,
                and I enjoy riding my <strong>fixed gear bike</strong>. Music and cycling help shape how I
                approach engineering—disciplined, creative, and always improving.
            </p>
